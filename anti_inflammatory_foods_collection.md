# Food Groups That Help Lower Inflammation — Curated Collection

## Introduction

This curated collection gathers 15 high-quality resources about food groups, dietary patterns, and practical tools shown to reduce chronic inflammation. It blends primary research (index development and reviews), evidence syntheses, guideline-style public resources, books, practical recipe repositories, apps, and multimedia explainers so readers can explore mechanisms, evaluate evidence strength, and apply anti-inflammatory choices in everyday life. The scope emphasizes whole-food groups and dietary patterns (Mediterranean, plant-forward, omega-3–rich foods, fiber- and polyphenol-rich items) rather than single “miracle” supplements, and it positions diet within a broader lifestyle and clinical context.

Use the categories to find scientific evidence, clinical guidance, practical meal ideas, or multimedia primers. Tags highlight key topics (e.g., `omega-3`, `polyphenols`, `Mediterranean`, `recipes`, `evidence-grade`). Each annotated entry below (100–200 words) summarizes: what the source covers, why it is valuable, who will find it useful, and limitations/caveats. Start with “Guidelines & Organizations” for quick, patient-facing guidance; consult “Scientific Reviews & Studies” when you need evidence depth; and use “Practical Tools & Recipes” and “Media” for hands-on implementation and engaging explainers.

## Scientific Reviews & Studies

### 1) Designing and developing a literature-derived, population-based Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) — Shivappa et al., 2014

What the source covers: This paper describes the derivation and validation of the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), a literature-derived scoring system that quantifies the inflammatory potential of diets based on food and nutrient effects observed across epidemiologic studies.

Why it is valuable: The DII provides a standardized, reproducible metric used in hundreds of population studies to connect whole-diet exposures to biomarkers and disease outcomes. It’s especially helpful when translating complex dietary data (e.g., food-frequency questionnaires) into an interpretable exposure variable.

Who would find it useful: Nutrition epidemiologists, graduate students, clinicians interpreting population-level evidence, and researchers wanting a validated dietary exposure metric.

Limitations/caveats: The DII aggregates diverse foods and nutrients into a single score, which can obscure the effects of specific food groups. It depends on the quality of dietary assessment and food composition tables and is a research tool rather than a clinical diagnostic.

### 2) Mediterranean dietary pattern, inflammation and endothelial function: systematic review & meta-analysis — Schwingshackl & Hoffmann, 2014

What the source covers: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and controlled trials assessing how Mediterranean dietary patterns affect inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP, IL-6) and endothelial function.

Why it is valuable: Provides pooled estimates across intervention trials to quantify the anti-inflammatory and vascular benefits associated with Mediterranean-style eating, supporting evidence-based dietary recommendations.

Who would find it useful: Clinicians, registered dietitians, guideline developers, and researchers seeking aggregated trial data about pattern-based interventions.

Limitations/caveats: Included trials vary in intervention details, duration, and adherence measures; heterogeneity and study quality influence pooled estimates and may limit applicability to all populations.

### 3) Marine omega-3 fatty acids and inflammatory processes: effects, mechanisms and clinical relevance — Calder, 2015

What the source covers: A mechanistic and translational review of how long-chain marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA and DHA) modulate inflammatory signaling, eicosanoid profiles, and clinical inflammatory markers.

Why it is valuable: Links molecular pathways to clinical outcomes, clarifying when increased dietary or supplemental omega-3 intake is likely to translate into measurable reductions in systemic inflammation.

Who would find it useful: Cardiologists, rheumatologists, nutrition scientists, and clinicians evaluating omega-3 advice for patients.

Limitations/caveats: Clinical effects vary by dose, formulation (EPA vs. DHA), baseline intake, and disease state; not all inflammatory conditions respond similarly and supplements are not a substitute for whole-food dietary patterns.

### 4) Whole grain consumption and inflammatory markers: systematic literature review of randomized control trials — Milesi et al., 2022

What the source covers: Systematic review focused on randomized controlled trials that tested whole-grain interventions and measured systemic inflammatory markers such as CRP.

Why it is valuable: Emphasizes practical, food-level changes—substituting refined grains with whole grains—and their consistent, though sometimes modest, effects on lowering inflammation through mechanisms like fiber fermentation, SCFA production, and antioxidant intake.

Who would find it useful: Dietitians, public-health professionals, clinicians advising patients on fiber and whole-grain intake.

Limitations/caveats: Trials vary by whole-grain type, degree of processing, participant characteristics, and length; some effects may be mediated by changes in weight or glycemic control.
